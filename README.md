**Project Title:** CancerVision: Early Breast Cancer Detection with Deep Learning

**Description:**

CancerVision is a Python-based deep learning project that aims to assist in the early detection of breast cancer. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, enabling the analysis of medical images to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. This project has the potential to enhance early diagnosis and personalized treatment approaches for breast cancer.

**Key Features:**

* **CNN-powered Image Classification:** Employs a CNN architecture trained to classify breast cancer images as benign or malignant.
* **Python Implementation:** Utilizes Python libraries for efficient image processing and model development.
* **Early Detection Potential:** Aims to contribute to earlier identification of breast cancer, leading to improved patient outcomes.

**Getting Started:**

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.x (Download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Essential Deep Learning Libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, numpy, keras) - installation instructions may vary
* Image Dataset (Breast cancer image dataset, details on acquisition to be added)

**Installation:**

1. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):** Use tools like `venv` or `conda` to create an isolated environment for project dependencies.
2. **Install dependencies:** Refer to the documentation of your chosen deep learning library (e.g., `pip install tensorflow` , `pip install kera`, 'pip install keras', ' pip install skimage' ).

**Project Structure:**

1. Create a Folder with main title.
2. Create Flask Folder.
3. Create testimage Folder(folder includes testimages) .
4. Create Uploads Folder. 

**Running the Project:**

1. **Prepare the dataset:** Download and pre-process the breast cancer image dataset according to the instructions provided. 
2. **Train the model:** Run the Bcancer_Vision responsible for training the CNN model.
4. **Test on new images:** If applicable, include instructions on using the model for prediction on new breast cancer images.
5.Running the Bcancer_Vision script in Google Colab creates an (.h5) file containing pre-processed data for breast cancer image analysis. This h5 file is then loaded and utilized by the app.py script for further processing or model training."
